where do i want my main game loop? my game loop has to respond to user requests. does it belong in the game instance, or in main? if i put it in game instance, then game becomes more of a controller than a model as it has to deal with user input. i can instantiate a ui object inside of game or else pass one in, but then it seems to mess up roles of classes. i think for now i will keep gameloop in main.

MVC:

controller can update model and view
model can update view

do i really want to have only arrays put out from the dom class? it's consistent, but it's weird. maybe update variable names to reflect type?

questions about direct of data flow. for example, should controller push its input to game, or should game instead pull its data from controller? i think i will push from controller instead of pull from controller.
